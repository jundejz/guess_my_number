    <h1>Guess the Number</h1>
    <p><strong>"Guess the Number"</strong> is a game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number 
        between 1 and 100. The app provides instant feedback, letting the player know if their guess is too high, too low, or correct. 
       I have coded the app in Python and deployed it using Streamlit.</p>
    <p>See the screenshot below for a preview of the app!</p>
